#### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Step 1: Prepare the Ingredients**  
- Chop the onion and garlic: Ask an adult to help you finely chop the onion and garlic. Be careful with the knife and keep your fingers away from the blade.  
- Measure everything: Use measuring spoons to get the right amounts of olive oil, tomato purée, oregano, salt, and pepper.

**Step 2: Cook the Onion and Garlic**  
- Put the large frying pan on medium heat. Add 30ml (2 tablespoons) of olive oil.  
- Wait 1 minute for the oil to warm up, then add the chopped onion and garlic. Stir with a wooden spoon and cook for 5 minutes until the onion is soft.

**Step 3: Brown the Beef Mince**  
- Add the 600g of beef mince to the pan with the onions and garlic.  
- Use the wooden spoon to break up the mince as it cooks. Stir and cook for about 8 minutes until the mince is brown all over.

**Step 4: Add the Tomatoes and Seasoning**  
- Stir in 30g (2 tablespoons) of tomato purée and 5g (1 teaspoon) of dried oregano.  
- Pour in the 2 tins of chopped tomatoes (800g total).  
- Add 5g (1 teaspoon) of salt and 2g (½ teaspoon) of black pepper.  
- Stir it all together. Let the sauce simmer (small bubbles) for 20 minutes, stirring every few minutes.

**Step 5: Cook the Spaghetti**  
- While the sauce simmers, fill a large saucepan with water and put it on high heat until it boils. Add a pinch of salt to the water.  
- When the water is boiling, add the 500g of spaghetti. Stir it gently so it doesn’t stick.  
- Cook the spaghetti for 10–12 minutes until it’s soft but still a little firm. Ask an adult to help you check if it’s ready.  
- Drain the spaghetti in a colander—ask an adult to help because the water is very hot.

**Step 6: Combine and Serve**  
- After 20 minutes, turn off the heat under the sauce.  
- Put the cooked spaghetti on five plates.  
- Spoon the Bolognese sauce over the spaghetti on each plate.  
- Sprinkle some grated parmesan cheese on top if you want (optional).

**Step 7: Enjoy and Clean Up**  
- Eat your Spaghetti Bolognese while it’s hot—enjoy!  
- After you’re done, clean up by washing the pans, utensils, and chopping board (or ask an adult to help with the dishwasher).

#### Safety Tips
- Knife Safety: Get an adult to chop the onion and garlic for you. Knives are sharp, so be careful!  
- Hot Stuff: Use oven mitts or ask an adult to help with hot pans and boiling water.  
- Stove: Turn off the stove when you’re done cooking.

#### Optional Tips
- More Flavor: Add a tiny pinch of sugar to the sauce if you like it less tangy.  
- No Meat?: Use veggie mince instead of beef for a vegetarian version.  
- Garlic Bread: Ask an adult to help make garlic bread to go with it if you have time.
