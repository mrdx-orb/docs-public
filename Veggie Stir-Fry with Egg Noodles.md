#### Equipment Needed
- Large wok or frying pan (for stir-fry)

- Wooden spoon (for stirring)
- Grater (for ginger)
- Measuring spoons
- Colander (for draining noodles)

#### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Step 1: Prepare the Ingredients**  
- Chop the bell peppers, broccoli, and carrots into small, bite-sized pieces. Ask an adult to help you with the knife—keep your fingers away from the blade!  
- Slice the spring onions into thin pieces and set aside.  
- Peel and grate the 20g of ginger using a grater (ask an adult if it’s tricky).  
- Peel and chop the 2 garlic cloves into tiny bits.  

**Step 2: Cook the Noodles**  
- Fill a medium saucepan with water and put it on high heat until it boils. Add a pinch of salt.  
- Add the 400g of egg noodles to the boiling water. Stir gently so they don’t stick.  
- Cook for 4–5 minutes until soft (check the packet). Ask an adult to help you test if they’re ready.  
- Drain the noodles in a colander—ask an adult to help because the water is hot. Set the noodles aside.  

**Step 3: Make the Sauce**  
- In a small bowl, mix 75ml of soy sauce, 15g (1 tablespoon) of honey, the grated ginger, and 10g (1 tablespoon) of cornflour with 50ml of water. Stir until smooth. Set it aside.  

**Step 4: Stir-Fry the Veggies**  
- Put the large wok or frying pan on medium heat. Add 30ml (2 tablespoons) of sesame oil.  
- Wait 1 minute for the oil to warm up, then add the chopped garlic. Stir for 30 seconds.  
- Add the bell peppers, broccoli, and carrots. Stir-fry for 6–8 minutes until they’re tender but still a bit crunchy.  

**Step 5: Combine Everything**  
- Add the cooked noodles and the sauce to the pan with the veggies. Stir everything together for 2–3 minutes until the sauce thickens and coats the noodles and veggies.  
- Sprinkle the spring onions on top and give it a final stir.  

**Step 6: Serve and Enjoy**  
- Turn off the heat. Spoon the stir-fry onto five plates, giving everyone a good mix of noodles and veggies.  
- Eat it while it’s hot—yum!  

**Step 7: Clean Up**  
- Wash the pans, utensils, and chopping board after you’re done (or ask an adult to help with the dishwasher).  

#### Safety Tips
- Knife Safety: Get an adult to chop the veggies for you. Knives are sharp!  
- Hot Stuff: Use oven mitts or ask an adult to help with hot pans and boiling water.  
- Stove: Turn off the stove when you’re finished cooking.  

#### Optional Tips
- Extra Veggies: Add some frozen peas or sweetcorn if you like.  
- Spicy Kick: Ask an adult if you can add a tiny bit of chilli sauce (if you like it spicy).  
- Crunch: Toast some sesame seeds to sprinkle on top if you have them.
