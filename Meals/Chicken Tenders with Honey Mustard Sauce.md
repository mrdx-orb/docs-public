These crispy baked chicken tenders with a sweet and tangy honey mustard sauce are perfect for a fun family dinner! Serve with roasted sweet potato wedges and steamed green beans.

**Serves:** 5  
**Prep Time:** 25 minutes  
**Ingredients:**  
- 600g chicken breast (cut into strips)  
- 100g breadcrumbs (plain or panko for extra crunch)  
- 2 large eggs  
- 100ml olive oil (for baking or frying)  
- 500g sweet potatoes (for wedges)  
- 500g green beans  
- 200g honey  
- 150g mustard (Dijon or wholegrain)  
- 1 tsp (5g) salt  
- 1 tsp (5g) black pepper  
- 1 lemon (for juice)  

## Steps

1. **Preheat the Oven:**  
   - Set your oven to 200°C (400°F) and line a baking tray with parchment paper.  

2. **Prepare the Chicken Tenders:**  
   - Cut the chicken breasts into even strips (about 2-3 inches long).  
   - Beat the eggs in a shallow bowl. Spread breadcrumbs on a plate and season with half the salt and pepper.  
   - Dip each chicken strip into the egg, then coat with breadcrumbs. Place on the baking tray.  

3. **Bake the Tenders:**  
   - Drizzle 50ml of olive oil over the coated chicken strips. Bake for 15-20 minutes, flipping halfway, until golden and cooked through (internal temperature 75°C/165°F).  

4. **Make Sweet Potato Wedges:**  
   - Peel and cut sweet potatoes into wedges. Toss with 50ml olive oil, the remaining salt, and pepper.  
   - Spread on a separate baking tray and bake alongside the tenders for 20 minutes, turning once, until crispy.  

5. **Cook Green Beans:**  
   - Steam or boil the green beans for 5-7 minutes until tender but crisp. Drain and set aside.  

6. **Prepare Honey Mustard Sauce:**  
   - In a small bowl, mix honey, mustard, and the juice of half a lemon until smooth. Adjust sweetness or tanginess to taste with extra honey or lemon.  

7. **Serve:**  
   - Arrange chicken tenders, sweet potato wedges, and green beans on plates. Serve with a side of honey mustard sauce for dipping.  

## Tips
- **Speed It Up:** Prep sweet potato wedges while the tenders bake to stay within 25 minutes.  
- **Kid-Friendly:** The sweet honey mustard balances the mustard’s tang, appealing to your children (aged 14, 10, and 7). Omit pepper if they prefer milder flavors.  
- **Leftovers:** Refrigerate extras in an airtight container for up to 2 days; reheat in the oven at 180°C for 10 minutes.  
- **Safety:** Ask an adult to handle the oven and check chicken temperature.  

Have fun cooking, and enjoy your meal!
