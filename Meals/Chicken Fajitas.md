Serves: 5Prep Time: 25 minutesIngredients:  

600g chicken breast (cut into thin strips)  
400g bell peppers (mix of red, yellow, green—sliced into strips)  
200g onions (peeled and sliced)  
100g guacamole (store-bought or homemade)  
10 medium tortillas  
100ml olive oil  
1 tsp (5g) salt  
1 tsp (5g) black pepper  
1 tsp (5g) ground cumin  
1 tsp (5g) chili powder (optional, reduce for milder taste)

Steps

Get Ready:  

Wash your hands really well.  
Grab a chopping board and a sharp knife (ask an adult to help if needed).  
Put a large frying pan on the stove, but don’t turn it on yet.


Prep the Chicken and Veggies:  

Cut the chicken breasts into thin strips and put them in a bowl.  
Slice the bell peppers and onions into thin strips and set them aside in another bowl.  
If making guacamole, mash an avocado with a fork and add a pinch of salt (or use store-bought).


Cook the Chicken:  

Turn the stove to medium-high heat and add 50ml of olive oil to the pan.  
Add the chicken strips to the pan. Sprinkle with salt, black pepper, cumin, and chili powder (if using).  
Cook for about 5-7 minutes, stirring with a wooden spoon, until the chicken is cooked through and no pink remains.


Add the Veggies:  

Push the chicken to one side of the pan.  
Add the remaining 50ml of olive oil to the empty side.  
Toss in the sliced peppers and onions. Stir everything together and cook for 5-7 minutes until the veggies are soft but still a bit crunchy.


Warm the Tortillas:  

While the veggies cook, warm the tortillas. You can do this by wrapping them in foil and popping them in the oven at 180°C for 5 minutes, or heat them in the microwave for 30 seconds (ask an adult for help with the oven).


Serve It Up:  

Spoon the chicken and veggie mix onto a big plate.  
Let everyone grab a tortilla, add some chicken and veggies, and top with a spoonful of guacamole.  
Roll it up and enjoy—messy is part of the fun!



Tips

Speed It Up: Chop the veggies the night before to save time.  
Kid-Friendly: Skip the chili powder if your younger siblings (10 and 7) don’t like spice, or use a tiny pinch for flavor.  
Leftovers: Save any extra filling for lunch tomorrow—reheat it in the pan for 2-3 minutes!

Have a blast making fajitas, and don’t forget to tidy up when you’re done!
