These crispy baked chicken tenders with a sweet and tangy honey mustard sauce are super fun to make and eat! Serve with roasted sweet potato wedges and steamed green beans for a yummy dinner.

**Serves:** 5  
**Prep Time:** 25 minutes  
**Ingredients:**  
- 600g chicken breast (cut into strips)  
- 100g breadcrumbs (plain or panko for extra crunch)  
- 2 large eggs  
- 100ml olive oil (for baking)  
- 500g sweet potatoes (for wedges)  
- 500g green beans  
- 200g honey  
- 150g mustard (Dijon or wholegrain)  
- 1 tsp (5g) salt  
- 1 tsp (5g) black pepper  
- 1 lemon (for juice)  

## Steps

1. **Preheat the Oven:**  
   - Ask an adult to help set the oven to 200°C (400°F). Line a baking tray with parchment paper.

2. **Prepare the Chicken Tenders:**  
   - Cut the chicken breasts into even strips (about 2-3 inches long) with a knife (get an adult’s help if needed).  
   - Beat the eggs in a shallow bowl. Spread breadcrumbs on a plate and mix in half the salt and pepper.  
   - Dip each chicken strip into the egg, then coat with breadcrumbs. Place on the baking tray.

3. **Bake the Tenders:**  
   - Drizzle 50ml of olive oil over the chicken strips. Ask an adult to put the tray in the oven.  
   - Bake for 15-20 minutes, flipping the tenders halfway, until golden and cooked through (check with an adult that it’s 75°C/165°F inside).

4. **Make Sweet Potato Wedges:**  
   - Peel and cut the sweet potatoes into wedges. Toss with 50ml olive oil, the remaining salt, and pepper.  
   - Spread on a separate baking tray and bake alongside the tenders for 20 minutes, turning once, until crispy.

5. **Cook Green Beans:**  
   - Steam or boil the green beans for 5-7 minutes until tender but still a bit crunchy. Drain and set aside.

6. **Prepare Honey Mustard Sauce:**  
   - In a small bowl, mix the honey, mustard, and juice from half a lemon until smooth. Taste it and add more honey or lemon if you like!

7. **Serve:**  
   - Put some chicken tenders, sweet potato wedges, and green beans on each plate. Serve with the honey mustard sauce for dipping. Enjoy!

## Tips
- **Speed It Up:** Prep the sweet potato wedges while the tenders bake to stay on time.  
- **Kid-Friendly:** The honey makes the sauce sweet for your younger siblings (10 and 7)—skip pepper if they don’t like it.  
- **Leftovers:** Save extras in the fridge for tomorrow’s lunch; reheat in the oven at 180°C for 10 minutes.  
- **Safety:** Ask an adult to handle the oven and check the chicken temperature.

Have fun cooking tomorrow, and don’t forget to clean up!
