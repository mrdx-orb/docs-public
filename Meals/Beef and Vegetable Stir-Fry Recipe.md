- 1 tsp (5g) salt  
- 1 tsp (5g) black pepper  

## Steps

1. **Get Ready:**  
   - Wash your hands really well.  
   - Grab a chopping board and a sharp knife (ask an adult to help if you’re unsure).  
   - Put a large frying pan or wok on the stove, but don’t turn it on yet.

2. **Chop the Veggies:**  
   - Slice the bell peppers into thin strips.  
   - Break the broccoli into small florets.  
   - Peel the carrots and slice them into thin rounds.  
   - Peel the onions and chop them into small pieces.  
   - Put all the chopped veggies into a bowl and set it aside.

3. **Cook the Beef:**  
   - Turn the stove to medium-high heat and add 50ml of olive oil to the pan.  
   - Add the beef mince to the pan. Use a wooden spoon to break it up and stir it around.  
   - Cook for about 5-7 minutes until the beef is browned all over with no pink left.  
   - Sprinkle in the salt and black pepper while stirring.

4. **Add the Veggies:**  
   - Push the beef to one side of the pan.  
   - Add the remaining 50ml of olive oil to the empty side.  
   - Toss in all the chopped veggies. Stir everything together and cook for 5 minutes until the veggies start to soften.

5. **Make it Tasty:**  
   - Pour the soy sauce and sprinkle the ground ginger over the beef and veggies.  
   - Stir well to coat everything evenly. Cook for another 3-5 minutes until the veggies are tender but still a bit crunchy.

6. **Serve It Up:**  
   - Spoon the cooked brown rice onto 5 plates (about half a cup per person).  
   - Divide the beef and veggie mix evenly on top of the rice.  
   - Let everyone dig in while it’s hot—enjoy!

## Tips
- **Speed It Up:** Have an adult pre-chop the veggies if you’re short on time.  
- **Kid-Friendly:** If your siblings (10 and 7) don’t like strong flavors, use less ginger or add a splash of honey to sweeten it
