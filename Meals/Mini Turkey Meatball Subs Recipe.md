These tasty turkey meatball subs with melty mozzarella are a fun and filling dinner! Serve with crunchy carrot sticks for a yummy side.

**Serves:** 5  
**Prep Time:** 30 minutes  
**Ingredients:**  
- 500g ground turkey  
- 100g breadcrumbs  
- 1 large egg  
- 200g mozzarella cheese (sliced)  
- 5-6 whole wheat rolls  
- 400g marinara sauce  
- 500g carrots (cut into sticks)  
- 50ml olive oil  
- 1 tsp (5g) salt  
- 1 tsp (5g) black pepper  
- 1 tsp (5g) dried oregano  
- 1 tsp (5g) garlic powder  

## Steps

1. **Get Ready:**  
   - Wash your hands really well.  
   - Grab a mixing bowl, a baking tray, and a sharp knife (ask an adult to help if needed).  
   - Preheat the oven to 200°C (400°F).

2. **Make the Meatballs:**  
   - In a bowl, mix the ground turkey, breadcrumbs, egg, salt, pepper, oregano, and garlic powder until just combined.  
   - Roll the mixture into small meatballs (about 1.5 inches each—make around 15-20).  
   - Place the meatballs on a greased baking tray.

3. **Bake the Meatballs:**  
   - Drizzle 25ml of olive oil over the meatballs.  
   - Ask an adult to put the tray in the oven. Bake for 15-20 minutes until cooked through (check with an adult that it’s 75°C/165°F inside).

4. **Warm the Sauce and Rolls:**  
   - While the meatballs cook, heat the marinara sauce in a small pot over low heat, stirring occasionally (about 5 minutes).  
   - Slice the whole wheat rolls in half and lightly toast them in the oven for the last 2-3 minutes (ask an adult to help).

5. **Prepare Carrot Sticks:**  
   - Peel the carrots and cut them into sticks (ask an adult for help with the knife).  
   - Set aside for serving.

6. **Assemble the Subs:**  
   - Place 3-4 meatballs on the bottom half of each roll.  
   - Spoon some warm marinara sauce over the meatballs and top with a slice of mozzarella.  
   - Put the top half of the roll on and serve with carrot sticks on the side.

## Tips
- **Speed It Up:** Make the meatballs the night before and refrigerate them to save time.  
- **Kid-Friendly:** If your siblings (10 and 7) don’t like strong flavors, skip the garlic powder or use less.  
- **Leftovers:** Save extras for Sunday lunch—reheat in the microwave for 1-2 minutes.  
- **Safety:** Ask an adult to handle the oven, knife, and check meat temperature.

Have fun making these subs, and enjoy your Saturday dinner!
