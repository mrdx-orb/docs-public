#### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Step 1: Prepare the Soup Base**  
- Finely chop 150g onion and mince 10g garlic (2 cloves).  
- Heat 15ml (1 tablespoon) olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat.  
- Add the chopped onion and cook for 3–4 minutes, stirring occasionally, until soft.  
- Add the minced garlic and cook for 1 minute, stirring to avoid burning.

**Step 2: Make the Soup**  
- Pour in 800g tinned chopped tomatoes and 400ml vegetable stock.  
- Stir well and bring to a simmer (small bubbles) for 10 minutes.  
- Use a blender or stick blender to purée the soup until smooth (ask an adult to help with the blender).  
- Stir in 100ml double cream, 5g (1 teaspoon) salt, and 2g (½ teaspoon) black pepper.  
- Simmer for another 2 minutes, then turn off the heat.

**Step 3: Prepare the Grilled Cheese**  
- Spread a thin layer of butter (about 5g per slice) on one side of each of the 10 bread slices.  
- Place 20g grated cheddar cheese on the unbuttered side of 5 slices. Top with the remaining 5 slices, buttered side out.  

**Step 4: Cook the Grilled Cheese**  
- Heat a frying pan over medium heat.  
- Place 1–2 sandwiches in the pan (depending on size) and cook for 2–3 minutes on each side until golden brown and the cheese melts.  
- Repeat with the remaining sandwiches (ask an adult to help if needed).  
- Cut each sandwich into halves or triangles.

**Step 5: Serve and Enjoy**  
- Ladle the tomato soup into five bowls (about 250ml per person).  
- Serve each bowl with 1–2 grilled cheese halves on the side for dipping.  
- Enjoy your warm and cozy meal!
