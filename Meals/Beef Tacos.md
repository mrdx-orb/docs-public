#### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Step 1: Prepare the Ingredients**  
- Finely chop 150g onion and mince 10g garlic (2 cloves).  
- Shred 150g lettuce and grate 200g cheddar cheese. Set aside for toppings.

**Step 2: Cook the Beef Filling**  
- Heat 15ml (1 tablespoon) of olive oil in a large frying pan over medium heat.  
- Add the chopped onion and cook for 3–4 minutes, stirring occasionally, until soft.  
- Add the minced garlic and cook for 1 minute, stirring to avoid burning.  
- Add 600g beef mince to the pan. Break it up with a wooden spoon and cook for 5–7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until browned.  

**Step 3: Season the Beef**  
- Stir in 5g (1 teaspoon) chilli powder, 5g (1 teaspoon) ground cumin, 5g (1 teaspoon) salt, and 2g (½ teaspoon) black pepper.  
- Cook for another 2 minutes, stirring to coat the beef evenly with the spices.  

**Step 4: Prepare the Taco Shells**  
- If using hard taco shells, preheat the oven to 180°C and warm the 10 shells for 3–5 minutes (check packet instructions).  
- If using soft tortillas, warm them in a dry pan or microwave for 20–30 seconds per side.  

**Step 5: Assemble the Tacos**  
- Spoon the beef mixture into each taco shell (about 60g per shell).  
- Top with shredded lettuce, a sprinkle of grated cheese (about 20g per person), and a tablespoon of salsa (about 20g per taco).  

**Step 6: Serve and Enjoy**  
- Serve 2 tacos per person on each plate.  
- Eat while warm and enjoy the fun of customizing your tacos!
