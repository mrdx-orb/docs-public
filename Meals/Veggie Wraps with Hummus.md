#### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Step 1: Preheat the Oven and Prepare Vegetables**  
- Preheat your oven to 200°C (180°C fan, Gas Mark 6).  
- Slice 200g courgettes into thin rounds and cube 200g sweet potatoes into small pieces.  
- Spread the courgettes and sweet potatoes on a baking tray. Drizzle with 15ml (1 tablespoon) olive oil, 2g (½ teaspoon) salt, and 1g (¼ teaspoon) black pepper. Toss to coat.  
- Roast in the oven for 15–20 minutes, turning halfway, until tender and slightly golden (set a timer).

**Step 2: Prepare the Hummus Mix**  
- In a bowl (or directly on the tortillas), mix 200g hummus with 15ml (1 tablespoon) lemon juice, the remaining 15ml (1 tablespoon) olive oil, 3g (½ teaspoon) salt, and 1g (¼ teaspoon) black pepper. Stir until smooth (optional step; can spread directly if preferred).

**Step 3: Prepare the Remaining Ingredients**  
- Slice 1 avocado into thin pieces.  
- Measure out 150g mixed greens.

**Step 4: Assemble the Wraps**  
- Lay out the 5 tortillas on a clean surface.  
- Spread about 40g of the hummus mixture evenly over each tortilla, leaving a small border around the edges.  
- Layer 30g mixed greens, a few avocado slices, and 40g roasted vegetables (courgettes and sweet potatoes) on one half of each tortilla.

**Step 5: Roll the Wraps**  
- Fold the bottom edge of the tortilla up over the filling, then fold in the sides and roll tightly to close.  
- Repeat for all 5 tortillas.

**Step 6: Serve and Enjoy**  
- Place each wrap on a plate (1 per person).  
- Serve immediately and enjoy your fresh veggie wraps with warm roasted vegetables!
