## Steps

1. **Get Ready:**  
   - Wash your hands really well.  
   - Grab a chopping board, a sharp knife, and two pots (one for chili, one for cornbread batter—ask an adult to help if needed).  
   - Preheat the oven to 200°C (400°F) for the cornbread.

2. **Chop the Veggies:**  
   - Chop the courgettes and onions into small pieces.  
   - Mince the garlic (use a garlic press or ask an adult to help).  
   - Set the veggies aside in a bowl.

3. **Make the Chili:**  
   - Heat 50ml olive oil in a large pot over medium heat.  
   - Add the onions and garlic, cooking for 3-4 minutes until soft.  
   - Stir in the courgettes, tinned tomatoes, kidney beans, black beans, chili powder, cumin, salt, and pepper.  
   - Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.

4. **Make Cornbread Muffins:**  
   - In a bowl, mix the polenta or ground rice, flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.  
   - In another bowl, beat the egg with the milk and 50ml olive oil.  
   - Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ones and stir until just combined.  
   - Spoon the batter into a greased muffin tin (makes about 12 small muffins).  
   - Ask an adult to bake in the oven for 20-25 minutes until golden.

5. **Finish and Serve:**  
   - Check the chili—it should be thick and tasty. Turn off the heat.  
   - Slice the cucumber for a fresh side.  
   - Serve the chili in bowls with a cornbread muffin and some cucumber slices on the side. Enjoy!

## Tips
- **Speed It Up:** Chop veggies the night before to save time.  
- **Kid-Friendly:** Use less chili powder (or none) if your siblings (10 and 7) don’t like spice—taste and adjust!  
- **Leftovers:** Save extra chili for Thursday lunch—reheat in the microwave for 2 minutes.  
- **Safety:** Ask an adult to help with the oven, stove, and knife.

Have fun cooking, and don’t forget to tidy up!
