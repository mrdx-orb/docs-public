#### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Step 1: Preheat the Oven**  
- Set your oven to **200°C (180°C fan, Gas Mark 6)** to preheat while you prepare the ingredients.

**Step 2: Prepare the Filling**  
- Chop finely: 400g mushrooms and 150g onion. Mince 10g garlic (2 cloves).  
- Heat 30ml (2 tablespoons) olive oil in a large frying pan over medium heat.  
- Cook the aromatics: Add the onion and garlic, cooking for **5 minutes** until soft and fragrant.  
- Add mushrooms: Stir in the chopped mushrooms and cook for **5–7 minutes**, stirring occasionally, until they release their moisture and it evaporates.  
- Add spinach: Stir in 200g spinach and cook for **2–3 minutes** until wilted (if using frozen, drain excess water first).  
- Season and mix: Remove from heat, stir in 100g grated cheddar, 5g salt, and 2g black pepper. Let the filling cool slightly.

**Step 3: Prepare the Pastry**  
- Roll or unfold: If using a 500g block of puff pastry, roll it out on a lightly floured surface to a **30x40cm rectangle**. If using ready-rolled, simply unfold it.  
- Add filling: Place the cooled filling in the center of the pastry, shaping it into a log.  
- Wrap it up: Fold the pastry over the filling, sealing the edges by pressing with your fingers or a fork. Trim excess pastry if necessary.  
- Transfer: Place the wellington on a baking tray lined with baking paper, seam-side down.  
- Glaze: Brush the top with the beaten egg for a golden finish.

**Step 4: Bake the Wellington**  
- Bake: Place the tray in the preheated oven and cook for **25–30 minutes**, or until the pastry is golden and crisp.

**Step 5: Prepare the Roast Potatoes**  
- Prep potatoes: Peel and cut 1kg potatoes into chunks while the wellington bakes.  
- Parboil: Boil the potatoes in a saucepan of water for **5 minutes**. Drain and shake to roughen the edges.  
- Season: Toss with 30g melted butter and a pinch of salt.  
- Roast: Spread on a roasting tray and place in the oven (on a separate shelf) for **30–35 minutes**, turning halfway, until golden and crispy.

**Step 6: Prepare the Seasonal Vegetables**  
- Prep veggies: Peel and chop 500g seasonal vegetables (e.g., carrots, parsnips, broccoli) into bite-sized pieces.  
- Cook: Steam or boil for **5–7 minutes** until tender.  
- Finish: Drain and toss with 20g butter and a pinch of salt.

**Step 7: Serve and Enjoy**  
- Rest: Remove the wellington from the oven and let it sit for **5 minutes**.  
- Slice and serve: Cut into five portions and plate with roast potatoes and seasonal vegetables.
